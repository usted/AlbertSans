Albert Sans is a modern geometric sans serif family. 
It is inspired by the type-characteristics made by scandinavian architects and designers in beginning of the 20th century.
Architects and designers like Knud V. Engelhardt (1882-1931), Gunnar Biilmann Petersen (1897-1968) and Thorvald Bindesb√∏ll (1846-1908) who contributed to the foundation of scandinavian typedesign.
