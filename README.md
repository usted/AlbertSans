# The Albert Sans Font Project 

Albert Sans is a modern geometric sans serif family. 
It is inspired by the nordic type-characteristics made by danish architects and designers, like Knud V. Engelhardt (1882-1931) in beginning of the 20th century.

Designed by the Danish type designer Andreas Rasmussen that started from the Latin portion of Poppins made by Jonny Pinhorn.

The Albert Sans family includes ten weight from Thin to Black and supports the Latin Extended glyph set and other western european languages.
